# Polyglot Poker

Welcome to polyglot poket. Much like the MVC todo apps this is a repo where the rules of poker hands has been implemented in many different langugaes.

## Challenge

Write a programme that takes and array of poker hands and returns an array of winning hands. Input poker hands should be formatted as an array of strings like this:

```
["4S 4H 4D 4C AS", "JS KD QC 10H 2C"]
```

If (above) is your input then the return value of your function should be

```
["4S 4H 4D 4C AS"]
```

because this is the winning hand with four of a kind.
